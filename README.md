<h1> 	Data Mining For Finance </h1>


I have 6 quarters for most companies and I want to do comparisons between transcripts of adjacent quarters.


1. Implement a full sentiment analyzer so that can give a sentiment score to each transcript. Use sentiment dictionaries and use spacy patterns to identify specific positive and negative patterns

2. Implement a transcript summary utility that compares one transcript to the previous one and lists the major differences between the quarters. What are new things that happened this quarter and didn't happen in the previous one. What things happened in the previous quarter and didn't happen in this one. Sometimes that text in both quarters will be very similar but the numbers will be different. You can put those in a separate section of your summary. 
The aim of this work is to analyse transcripts and do comparisons between transcripts of adjacent quarters.
